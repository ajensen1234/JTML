# Task for ce-feasibility-reviewer

You are a specialist document reviewer of an engineering IMPLEMENTATION PLAN (type refactor).
FIRST read the plan fully at: /home/ajj/repo/uf/JTML/docs/plans/2026-08-07-001-refactor-testability-mvvm-plan.md. Also read the origin requirements doc at: /home/ajj/repo/uf/JTML/docs/brainstorms/2026-08-07-testability-mvvm-refactor-requirements.md so you can check that the plan honors the R1-R16 / AE1-AE5 contract without dropping origin content. You may skim the repo (CMakeLists.txt, pixi.toml, src/core/optimizer_manager.cpp, example_studies/Kneel_1) to verify feasibility, but your findings are about the PLAN document.

<output-contract>
Return ONLY valid JSON matching this schema, no prose outside it:
{ reviewer: string, findings: [ {...} ], residual_risks: [string], deferred_questions: [string] }

Each finding: title(<=10 words), severity("P0"|"P1"|"P2"|"P3"), section, why_it_matters (2-4 sentences, lead with observable consequence), finding_type("error"|"omission"), autofix_class("safe_auto"|"gated_auto"|"manual"), confidence(in 0,25,50,75,100), evidence(ARRAY of >=1 direct quote from the plan), suggested_fix (required for safe_auto/gated_auto).

Rules:
- severity: P0-P3 only. finding_type error|omission. confidence anchors: 0/25 suppressed (never emit), 50 = FYI advisory, 75 = verified with concrete downstream consequence, 100 = airtight.
- Do not flag pedantic style, other-persona territory, already-resolved items, pre-existing repo issues the plan didn't introduce, speculative future-work, or lint-caught issues.
- Strawman rule: "do nothing/defer to later" is not a real alternative.
- Focus on: plan-internal consistency (U-ID references, dependencies, phase ordering), feasibility gaps, scope creep vs the origin contract, missing test scenarios, risk handling, and whether an implementer can start without inventing decisions.
</output-contract>

Return the JSON as your final output.

## Acceptance Contract
Acceptance level: attested
Completion is not accepted from prose alone. End with a structured acceptance report.

Criteria:
- criterion-1: Return concrete findings with file paths and severity when applicable

Required evidence: review-findings, residual-risks

Finish with a fenced JSON block tagged `acceptance-report` in this shape:
Use empty arrays when no items apply; array fields contain strings unless object entries are shown.
`criteriaSatisfied[].status` must be exactly one of: satisfied, not-satisfied, not-applicable.
`commandsRun[].result` must be exactly one of: passed, failed, not-run.
`manualNotes` and `notes` are optional strings; an empty string means no note and does not satisfy `manual-notes` evidence.
